# space-shooter

Little C++ game I made back in 2015 using SDL2. This was before I even knew what a game engine was.

Steps to build:
Clone and open the .sln in Visual Studio.
Install the Visual C++ build tools.
Make sure Visual studio is building in x86, not x64.
Right click the space-shooter project and click build.
Launch with F5 or using Local Windows Debugger.
